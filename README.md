# STM8 Programming
Have you ever wanted to understand the magic that links firmware and hadware? I did.
Specifically, I wanted learn how to program a STM8S003F3 on a very low level.

It is true that there are lots of tutorials available online from were you can
learn things about the topic like the following ones:
- [Lujji's STM8 bare metal programming](https://lujji.github.io/blog/bare-metal-programming-stm8/)
- [Vdudouyt's STM8 examples](https://github.com/vdudouyt/sdcc-examples-stm8)
- [Embedonix STM8 programming](http://embedonix.com/articles/embedded-projects/getting-started-with-stm8-development-part-1-blinking-a-led/)
- [Manual for SDCC](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/doc/sdccman.pdf)

I specially found Lujji's tutorial very useful because I wanted to write the code using
my favorite editor and compile it independently. Indeed it's an outstanding tutorial, I wouldn't have
bothered making my own, but I felt that there were some assumptions a bit to complex for
newbie to understand. Because of that, this project was started. The idea is to explain
everything in detail so a person with basic knowledge in microcontroller programming can
follow these examples without any issue.
