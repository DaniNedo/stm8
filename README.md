Have you ever wanted to understand the magic that links firmware and hadware? I did.
It is true that there are lots of tutorials available online from were you can learn,
however even those that are really good some times are a bit to straight forward for a
newbie to understand. Because of that, this project was started. The idea is to explain
everything in detail so a person with basic knowledge in microcontroller programming can
follow these examples without any issue.
